## Introduction

Company registration data is a valuable resource for gaining insights into economic trends, business development, and market dynamics. This project aims to provide a platform for exploring and predicting trends related to company registrations. Leveraging artificial intelligence techniques, we offer a robust system that can analyze historical data, generate insights, and make predictions about future registration trends.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from the Registrar of Companies or provide your own dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand the dataset with descriptive statistics, visualizations, and trend analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Use pre-trained models to predict company registration trends based on historical data.
- **Customization**: Adapt and extend the project to suit your specific use case or dataset.
- **Interactivity**: Visualize and interact with the data through a user-friendly web interface.
